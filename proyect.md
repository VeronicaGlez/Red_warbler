**Summary**

In this repository, you found the work generated to analyze Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in two warblers species *Vermivora chrysoptera and  V. cyanoptera*, two phenotypically divergent warblers that have a high rate of hibridization. The principal aim for this repository was  compare genome variation in golden-winged (Vermivora chrysoptera) and blue-winged (V. cyanoptera) warblers, which hybridize across a broad zone of eastern North America (Fig. 1).

Aditionally, the scripts generated for this proyect will serve as the basis for evaluate at genetic level to red warbler  (*Cardellina rubra*) an endemic species (with 3 subespecies) from Mexico as part of my doctoral project.

**Data**

The SNPs dataset was download from Data Dryad: (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kb610). The dataset contain 151 Individuals with genotype information generated from the ddRAD protocol, with individuals sampled across the range of both species.

**Results and discussion**

The exploratory evaluations made with Principal Component Analysis does not show clearly groups between species or hybrids (Fig. 2).

It is to be expected that given the high rate of hybridization between the populations, exists high genetic flow between them and a few differentiation.

It is not surprising that by resequencing the individuals and having a greater number of SNPS, a clearer difference can be seen between the groups and q
