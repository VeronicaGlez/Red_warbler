**Summary**

In this repository, you found the work generated to analyze Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in two warblers species *Vermivora chrysoptera and  V. cyanoptera*, two phenotypically divergent warblers that have a high rate of hibridization.

The principal aim for this repository was  compare genome variation in golden-winged (Vermivora chrysoptera) and blue-winged (V. cyanoptera) warblers, which hybridize across a broad zone of eastern North America (Fig 1).



The scripts generated for this proyect will serve as the basis for evaluate at genetic level to red warbler  (*Cardellina rubra*) an endemic species (with 3 subespecies) from Mexico as part of my doctoral project.
