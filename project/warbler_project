**Background**

***

In this repository, you found the work generated to analyze Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in two warblers species *Vermivora chrysoptera and  V. cyanoptera*, two phenotypically divergent warblers that have a high rate of hibridization.

**Objective**
The principal aim for this proyect was  compare genome variation in golden-winged (Vermivora chrysoptera) and blue-winged (V. cyanoptera) warblers, which hybridize across a broad zone of eastern North America  

**Secondary objectives**
1. Explore data sets with Principal Components Analysis for see if exist any estructure for dataset.
2. Make genetic diversity analysis between species and hybrids.
3. Evaluate admixture between phenotypes 
4. Aditionally, the scripts generated for this proyect will serve as the basis for evaluate at genetic level to red warbler  (*Cardellina rubra*) an endemic species (with 3 subespecies) from Mexico as part of my doctoral project.

**Data**

The SNPs datasets was download from Data Dryad: (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kb610).  The first dataset data_warbler.vcf contain  151 Individuals with genotype information generated from the ddRAD protocol, with individuals sampled across the range of both species.
Aditionally, I work with a second dataset 

**Results and discussion**

For the exploratory analyzes, I did not find a strong difference between the phenotypes of the species, (figure 2) it is possible that, given the high rate of hybridization, there is a large genetic flow between the populations, which would make it difficult to see any clear separation. The exploratory evaluations made with Principal Component Analysis does not show clearly groups between species or hybrids (Fig. 2).

In the other hand, the populations show very similar values of heterozygosity observed and expected  but the golden-winged warbler show most inbreet that the others populations (Table 1).

The evaluation of admixture analysis confirmed exploratory analysis with PCA  and not show any kind of structure between the populations (k=1).





It is not surprising that by resequencing the individuals and having a greater number of SNPS, a clearer difference can be seen between the groups and q
