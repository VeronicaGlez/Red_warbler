## **Landscape genomics of the red warbler (Cardellina rubra) in Mexican fragmented forests**

In the last 50 years, Mexico lost about 50% of its forests because of land use change. Even though birds have been considered as highly tolerant to disturbed environments because of their ability to fly, recent analyses suggest that this is not necessarily true. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a sensitive tool that allows the detection of the effects of environmental changes on species at the population genetics level and enables inferences about connectivity, population sizes and adaptation.


This repository will contain the workflow generated in the project to analyze Ultraconservated Elements (UCEs) to evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity  of populations of Cardellina rubra.

### **Repository organization**


The repository will be organized as follow:
bin, data, graphics, meta, out.

**[bin](/bin)**

This folder will contain scripts to analyze UCEs.

**[data](/data)**

This folder will contain a txt file with a link to raw data sequences in drive

**[graphics](/graphics)**

This folder will contain figures and graphics related to the project.


**[meta](/meta)**

This folder will contain general information about samples (I.D, Geographical coordinates)

**[out](/out)**

Contains results of all analysis made in the research.
